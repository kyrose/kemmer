# Some examples
Other (media) server projects open sourced on GH. Useful for inspiration, new ideas, and figuring out what the hell we even need to do.

- [qq99/muvee][muvee]: Self-described as Netflix [served in] your home. Cool features: grabs metadata and posters automatically, finds sources for backups. 
- [openmediavault][omv]: next-gen network attached storage solution. (I don't know (yet) either). Integrations for SSH, (S)FTP, RSync, a BitTorrent client, and others. Definitely a project we should study.
- Plex: is the new hotness apparently. Lots of plugins and configs on GH. Plex itself is not open source though.
