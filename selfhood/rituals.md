# Personal rituals
## Read without the internet
Give a text my full attention while reading a section or reading for the block of time I've planned to read. Do not immediately look up unfamiliar terms and concepts introduced in the text, even when particular ideas appear pivotal to how it's interpreted. Instead, mark in the text or take note of the unfamiliar and look them up afterwards. Use context clues to roughly understand new ideas. If what I learn about an idea later fundamentally changes my understanding, then re-read the text.

## Complete a journaling activity from _The Moon List_ at the end of every week
Write responses by hand, in my notebook cum sketchbook. Respond with focus and in a (relatively) uninterrupted block of time. These prompts are meant to facilitate self-reflection: take the time to really process and deeply reflect.

## Sketch/write in my sketchbook daily
Let art become an extended ritual again.

## Sit outside, soak up the sun
Every day, at the same time of day *(time TDB)*, leave the apartment and sit in the sunshine. The fire escape is a nice, social-isolated option in this pandemic. Bring nothing with me—besides, perhaps, my coffee or a water bottle—and instead take the time to see and hear the world around me.

## Let AM/PM routines become rituals
That is: brushing my teeth, washing my face, applying serums and moisturizer, combing my hair are taken as parts to a single ritual. Leave my phone elsewhere. Breathe deeply. Perform each task with a calm intent. Let residual thoughts or dreams melt away for the moment.
