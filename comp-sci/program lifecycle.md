# Program lifecycle

## Phases
1. **Edit time** - Development time! Bug fixing, code refactoring, feature adding.
2. **Compile time** - when a program is compiled, or, translated from source code to machine code, resulting in an executable.
3. **Link time** - When connections between a program's necessary machine code components (e.g. external libraries) are made. These connections are either made by the compiler ([[static linking]]) or by the OS ([[dynamic linking]]).
4. **Distribution time** - When a program is transferred to a user.
5. **Installation time** - When a program is installed onto a machine.
6. **Load time** - When an OS adds the program's executable to its [[active memory]] in order to initiate program execution.
7. **Runtime** - The time during which a program is running (executed by machine).
