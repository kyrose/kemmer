# CLI script ideas

- a script that runs after I delete a package using either `apt autoremove foobar`, `snap remove foobar`, `flatpak uninstall foobar`, etc. then search for all residual files, including configs, and safely deletes them
- a version of @mwvd's lovely [i-am-home-now-i-love-u-sleep-tight](https://github.com/mwvd/i-am-home-now-i-love-u-sleep-tight), but it texts Aaron when I _actually_ go to sleep.
