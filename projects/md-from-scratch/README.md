# Markdown editor from scratch
Stop searching for the right software and start coding it!

## Todo:
- [ ] markdown-to-html renderer
- [ ] syntax color highlighting
- [ ] backlinks
- [ ] finder, search
- [ ] GUI
  - [ ] basic interface (simple and distraction free)
  - [ ] toggle between editor and preview
  - [ ] toggle day / night mode (automatically transition b/w modes based on time)
  - [ ] file tree
  - [ ] ability to hide files and directories from tree

## More complex features I want to add once the basics are covered:
- Drag and drop images
- (Anti-)library form that automatically populates a `anti-library.md` file with each new book entry, in a grid.
- web clipper/extension similar to Are.na's
