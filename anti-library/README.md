# Anti-library
This is a monument to what I--@kyrose--do not know. It can never encompass all I am ignorant of (that is too vast an entity), but it can serve as a reminder that there is so much to learn and so much I am capable of learning.

Currently there is no order to the books listed here; maybe I'll do that one day.

I hope you find this interesting.
