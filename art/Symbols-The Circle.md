# Symbolism of the circle

- Without beginning, without end, without direction. Isotropic.
- The circle has a _completeness which subsumes all space and time._
- Democracy, anarchism, an assembly of equals: the council circle, the round table

## Other representations:
### In the form of a halo
### In the form of a rainbow
_"I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth,"_ [Genesis 9:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9%3A13&version=NIV)

_"The I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head,..."_ [Revelation 10:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+10%3A1&version=NIV)

Iris is the Greek goddess of the rainbow, and a messenger of the gods (a feminine Hermes). **Again, we see the rainbow represent communication between the heavens and the earth.**

The union of earthly and divine

### The the form of the ouroboros
The circle symbolizes infinity. It is endless, a polygon with an infinite number of sides. The ouroboros consumes and rebirths itself _ad infinitum_. It is in a cycle of destruction and recreation, it never disappears, only changes.

Alchemical symbol for change. Continuous renewal, resurrection (the snake, continually reborn as it sheds its skin).

Harmony of opposites.
