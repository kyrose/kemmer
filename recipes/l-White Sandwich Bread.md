# White Sandwich Bread

## Ingredients
> - 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast
> - 1 pound all-purpose flour (3 ⅓ cups)
> - 1 cup of warm water (105°F)
> - 2 eggs
> - 3 tablespoons melted butter
> - 3 tablespoons white sugar
> - 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
> - 1 teaspoon olive oil
> - 1 tablespoon milk

## Steps
- [ ] Combine the warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of sugar into a bowl and leave it for 10-15 minutes.


- [ ] In a large mixing bowl combine half of the flour—or 2 cups, this measurement is not critical—with sugar and salt. Mix in 1 egg, the melted butter, and the yeast mixture then mix with a wooden spoon. Once the mixture starts to begin to form a dough switch from mixing with the spoon to your hands.


- [ ] Once your dough has reached the right consistency transfer it to a floured surface. It should be sticky and elastic but not sticking to your fingers. Knead the dough until it passes th window pane test, about 10-15 minutes.


- [ ] Form the dough into a smooth, round shape, gently tucking loose ends underneath. 


- [ ] Use the olive oil to coat the inside of a large bowl, then transfer the dough into the bowl. First upside down then flip it over.


- [ ] Cover the bowl and leave it until it has doubled, about 2 hours.


- [ ] Punch down the dough and then reform it to fit inside the loaf pan.


- [ ] Place the dough in a greased loaf pan. Cover and leave it for about 1 hour.


- [ ] Combine the milk with one egg and then gently brush it on top of the loaf.


- [ ] Preheat the oven to 375°F with a pan of water on the bottom rack.


- [ ] Place the loaf on the middle rack and bake for approximately 35 minutes.


- [ ] Let cool completely on a cooling rack.
